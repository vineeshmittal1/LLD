# Low Level Design (LLD) Assignments

A collection of Low Level Design solutions implementing various design patterns and object-oriented programming principles in Java.

## 📋 About

This repository contains my solutions to Low Level Design assignments, focusing on building scalable, maintainable, and well-structured software systems. Each assignment demonstrates the practical application of SOLID principles, design patterns, and best practices in software engineering.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Master SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion)
- Implement various design patterns (Creational, Structural, Behavioral)
- Design scalable and maintainable systems
- Practice object-oriented analysis and design
- Write clean, readable, and testable code


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: Java 
- **Concepts**: Object-Oriented Programming, Design Patterns, SOLID Principles

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- IDE of your choice (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code)

### Running the Code

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vineeshmittal1/LLD.git
cd LLD
```

2. Navigate to the specific assignment folder:
```bash
cd week-1-SOLID
```

3. Compile and run the Java files:
```bash
javac *.java
java MainClass
```

## 📚 Topics Covered

### Week 1: SOLID Principles
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## 🎓 Key Concepts

- **Design Patterns**: Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy, Decorator, and more
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction
- **System Design**: Class diagrams, UML, relationships between entities
- **Code Quality**: Clean code principles, refactoring, testing

## 📝 Assignment Format

Each assignment typically includes:
- Problem statement and requirements
- Implementation in Java
- Test cases and examples
- Design decisions and trade-offs
